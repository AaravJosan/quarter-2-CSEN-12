Application 2:

Intro: The provided code implements a hash table data structure to store and manage student data. The student data includes an ID and age for each student

Functions:

description and time complexity are part of the commented code

Justification: The hash table was chosen as the data structure because it provides efficient and easy operations for insertion, deletion, and search.
The chaining method is used to handle collisions, which allows for a simple way to manage the hash table when collisions occur.

A binary search tree can also be used to efficiently do operations such as insertion, deletion, and search. It has a time complexity of O(log n)
